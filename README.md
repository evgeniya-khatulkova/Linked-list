# Linked-list
Goal is to implement a linked list data structure in Ruby.

Add following functions for it to operate:
- #append(value) 
- #prepend(value)
- #size (returns the total number of nodes in the list)
- #head (returns the first node)
- #tail (returns the last node)
- #at(index)
- #pop (removes the last element from the list)
- #contains?(value) (returns true if the passed in value is in the list and otherwise returns false)
- #find(value) (returns the index of the node containing value, or nil if not found)
- #to_s (represent your LinkedList objects as strings)
